Here you enter other devices as triggers, such as wall switches, window sensors, etc.

| Column | Mandatory | Description |
|----------|:------------:|-------|
| ✓        |  Yes   | Enables/disables this table row. If not activated, this table row is ignored by the adapter. In the Adapter Options, under 'FURTHER OPTIONS > Input Validation', you can set that even disabled rows are checked for validity. |
| Name | Yes | Any name.|
| SC | Yes | See **State**.|
| State | Yes | An existing state as a trigger.<br><br>If you activate the SC option, the state will be created under `smartcontrol.x.userstates`, i.e. if you enter e.g. `Bath.Radio.on`, the state will be created as `smartcontrol.x.userstates.Bath.Radio.on`, which you then can use as trigger by setting the according **State value**. The state is created as type 'String', unless you enter `true` or `false` in 'State value', then it is created as 'boolean'. Use case: For example, you need a state to trigger, e.g. 'Home Cinema On', which is triggered by Alexa. This saves you from having to create states manually.
| State value | Yes | As soon as the value of the state matches this value, the trigger is activated. You can use `true`, `false`, numbers like `144`, or strings like `ABCDEF`.<br>Also, you can use comparison operators `<`, `>`, `>=` and `<=` before numbers. So to trigger, for example, if the temperature is higher than 20°C, you enter `>20`.<br>All spaces and quotation marks (`"` etc.) at the beginning and end are automatically removed.|
| Target off | No | Normally, the target devices are switched on when the triggering occurs (1. TARGET DEVICES > 'State to switch device on' / 'Value for on'). If you activate this option, the state is not turned on but off (1. TARGET DEVICES > 'State to switch device off' / 'Value for off').<br>Note: If **Toggle** is activated, this option is ignored.
| Toggle | No | If enabled, this allows a button (toggle) as trigger. When the target devices are off, the trigger turns them on, and vice versa (when they are on, the trigger turns them off). The adapter uses "State to switch device on" in "1. TARGET DEVICES" to determine if the device is already on.<br>Note: If **Target off** is activated at the same time, the **Target off** option is ignored, otherwise this would not make sense for a "toggle" option. |
